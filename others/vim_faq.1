.SS "1.1. What is Vim?"
.IX Subsection "1.1. What is Vim?"
Vim stands for Vi IMproved. It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so
many improvements that a name change was appropriate. Vim is a text editor
which includes almost all the commands from the Unix program \*(L"Vi\*(R" and a lot
of new ones. All commands can be given with the keyboard. This has the
advantage that you can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on
the screen. For those who want it, there is mouse support and a \s-1GUI\s0 version
with scrollbars and menus.
.PP
Vim is an editor, not a word processor. A word processor is used mainly
to do layout of text. This means positioning it, changing the way it
appears on output. More often than not, the final document is meant to
be printed or typeset or what have you, in order to present it in a
pleasing manner to others. Examples of word processors are Microsoft
Word, FrameMaker, and OpenOffice Writer.
.PP
An editor is simply for entering text. Any typesetting or laying out of the
document is secondary. With an editor, one's main concern is entering text,
not making the text look good. Examples of editors other than Vim and Vi
are Emacs, TextMate, Ultraedit and gedit. And Notepad.

.el .SS "2.5. I have a ``xyz'' (some) problem with Vim. How do I determine if it is a problem with my setup or with Vim?  / Have I found a bug in Vim?"
.IX Subsection "2.5. I have a xyz (some) problem with Vim. How do I determine if it is a problem with my setup or with Vim? / Have I found a bug in Vim?"
First, you need to find out, whether the error is in the actual runtime
files or any plugin that is distributed with Vim or whether it is a
simple side effect of any configuration option from your .vimrc or
\&.gvimrc. So first, start vim like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& vim \-u NONE \-U NONE \-N \-i NONE
.Ve
.PP
This starts Vim in nocompatible mode (\-N), without reading your viminfo
file (\-i \s-1NONE\s0), without reading any configuration file (\-u \s-1NONE\s0 for not
reading .vimrc file and \-U \s-1NONE\s0 for not reading a .gvimrc file) or even
plugin.
.PP
In this invocation, try to reproduce your problem. If the error
persists, the chance is good you've found a bug in Vim (see also
Question 2.6.)
.PP
If the error does not occur when starting Vim this way, then the problem
is either related to some plugin of yours or some setting in one of your
local setup files. You need to find out, what triggers the error, you
try starting Vim this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& vim \-u NONE \-U NONE \-N
.Ve
.PP
If the error occurs, the problem is your .viminfo file. Simply delete
the viminfo file then. If the error does not occur, try:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& vim \-u ~/.vimrc \-\-noplugin \-N \-i NONE
.Ve
.PP
This will simply use your .vimrc as configuration file, but not load any
plugins. If the error occurs this time, the error is possibly caused by
some configuration option inside your .vimrc file. Depending on the
length of your vimrc file, it can be quite hard to trace the origin
within that file.
.PP
The best way is to add :finish command in the middle of your .vimrc.
Then restart again using the same command line. If the error still
occurs, the bug must be caused because of a setting in the first half of
your .vimrc. If it doesn't happen, the problematic setting must be in
the second half of your .vimrc. So move the :finish command to the
middle of that half, of which you know that triggers the error and move
your way along, until you find the problematic option. If your .vimrc is
350 lines long, you need at a maximum 9 tries to find the offending line
(in practise, this can often be further reduced, since often lines
depend on each other).
.PP
If the problem does not occur, when only loading your .vimrc file, the
error must be caused by a plugin or another runtime file (indent
autoload or syntax script). Check the output of the :scriptnames command
to see what files have been loaded and for each one try to disable each
one by one and see which one triggers the bug. Often files that are
loaded by vim, have a simple configuration variable to disable them, but
you need to check inside each file separately.
.PP
You can also use the \-V command line argument to get more debug
information to analyze the problem:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ vim \-V2logfile
.Ve
.PP
You can increase the value passed to the \-V argument to get more debug
information. By also specifying a logfile name, this makes sure, the
debug messages don't appear on the screen and won't disturb you when
trying to reproduce the problem.

.SS "4.1. How do I use the help files?"
.IX Subsection "4.1. How do I use the help files?"
Help can be found for all functions of Vim. In order to use it, use the
\&\*(L":help\*(R" command.  This will bring you to the main help page. On that first
page, you will find explanations on how to move around. Basically, you move
around in the help pages the same way you would in a read-only document.
You can jump to specific subjects by using tags. This can be done in two
ways:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&   * Use the "<Ctrl\-]>" command while standing on the name of a command
\&  or option. This only works when the tag is a keyword.
\&  "<Ctrl\-LeftMouse>" and "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "<Ctrl\-]>".
\&
\&   * use the ":tag <subject>" command. This works with all characters.
.Ve
.PP
Use \*(L"<Ctrl\-T>\*(R" to jump back to previous positions in the help files. Use
\&\*(L":q\*(R" to close the help window.
.PP
If you want to jump to a specific subject on the help pages, use \*(L":help
{subject}\*(R". If you don't know what to look for, try \*(L":help index\*(R" to get a
list of all available subjects. Use the standard search keys to locate the
information you want. You can abbreviate the \*(L":help\*(R" command as \*(L":h\*(R".
.PP
For searching the help, see the next Question 4.2.
.PP

.PP
\&\fB:help online-help\fR
.SS "4.2. How do I search for a keyword in the Vim help files?"
.IX Subsection "4.2. How do I search for a keyword in the Vim help files?"
a)  You can press the CTRL-D key after typing the help keyword to get a
 list of all the help keywords containing the supplied pattern. You can
 also use the meta characters like *, \e+, etc to specify the help
 search pattern:
.PP
\&\fB:help init<C\-D\fR>
.PP
\&\fB:help str*()<C\-D\fR>
.PP
\&\fB:help '*indent<C\-D\fR>
.PP
b)  You can press the Tab key after typing a partial help keyword to expand
 to the matching keyword. You can continue to press the Tab key to see
 other keyword matches.
.PP
c)  From the help window, you can use the \*(L":tag\*(R" command to search for
 keywords. For example,
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :tselect /window
\&
\& This command will list all the help keywords containing the text
\& "window". You can select one from the list and jump to it.
.Ve
.PP
d)  You can use the \*(L":helpgrep\*(R" command to search for the given text in
 all the help files. The quickfix window will be opened with all the
 matching lines.

from within Vim. For example:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& :cd $VIMRUNTIME/doc
\& :helptags .
.Ve

.SS "4.6. Can I use compressed versions of the help files?"
.IX Subsection "4.6. Can I use compressed versions of the help files?"
Yes. You can compress the help files and still be able to view them with
Vim.  This makes accessing the help files a bit slower and requires the
\&\*(L"gzip\*(R" utility. Follow these steps to compress and use the Vim help files:
.PP
\&\- Compress all the help files using \*(L"gzip doc/*.txt\*(R".
.PP
\&\- Edit the \*(L"doc/tags\*(R" file and change the \*(L".txt\*(R" to \*(L".txt.gz\*(R" using
     :%s=\e(\et.*\e.txt\e)\et=\e1.gz\et=
.PP
\&\- Add the following line to your vimrc:
     set helpfile={dirname}/help.txt.gz
.PP
Where {dirname} is the directory where the help files are.  The gzip.vim
plugin supplied with the standard Vim distribution will take care of
decompressing the files.  You must make sure that \f(CW$VIMRUNTIME\fR is set to
where the other Vim files are, when they are not in the same location as
the compressed \*(L"doc\*(R" directory.
.PP
Note, that the :helpgrep command does not work with compressed help pages.

You can turn off the 'eol' option and turn on the 'binary' option to write
a file without the \s-1EOL\s0 at the end of the file:
.PP
.Vb 3

If you rather only like Vim not to write missing EOLs, you can reset the
\&'fixeol' option. This needs a Vim newer 7.4.785, so you should wrap this
in an if condition in your .vimrc like this:
.PP
.Vb 3

You can use the netrw.vim plugin, supplied with the standard Vim package,
to edit files over a network using ftp/scp/rcp/http. Using this plugin, Vim

.PP
You can use the \*(L"CTRL-W _\*(R" command or the \*(L":resize\*(R" ex command to increase

You can also set the following options to get better results with the above
commands:
.PP
Method 1:
Set the 'winminheight' option to 0:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :set winminheight=0
.Ve
.PP
By default, this option is set to 1.
This option controls the minimum height of an inactive window (when it is
not the current window).  When the 'winminheight' option is set to 0, only
the status line will be displayed for inactive windows.
.PP
Method 2:
Set the 'noequalalways' option and set the 'winheight' option to a large
value (like 99999):
.PP
.Vb 2
\& :set noequalalways
\& :set winheight=99999
.Ve
.PP
Now, the active window will always open to its maximum size, while the
other windows will stay present, but shrunken to just a status line.

With any of the above mentioned methods, you cannot restore the window
layout after zooming into a window.  If you want to restore the Vim window

\&\*(L"\e{\-}\*(R" doesn't just mean \*(L"as few as possible\*(R", it means \*(L"as few as
possible to make the whole pattern succeed\*(R". If it didn't match the 'p',
the whole pattern would fail (because of the \*(L"p\e@!\*(R") so it does match
the \*(L"p\*(R". It is a longer match, but it is the shortest match that makes
the whole pattern succeed.
.PP
If you wanted \*(L"as few as possible regardless\*(R" you would use \*(L"\e@>\*(R", which
basically divides a pattern up so that the pieces either side behave
independently. If the pattern were \*(L"a.\e{\-}\e@>p\e@!\*(R" then \*(L".\e{\-}\*(R" would
always match nothing because that's the smallest match that can succeed
when there are not other restrictions. The whole pattern then would
behave the same as \*(L"ap\e@!\*(R", i.e. it would match any \*(L"a\*(R" not followed by
a \*(L"p\*(R").
.PP
This means, it matches as few as possible 'a's without trying to keep
going until Vim finds the longest match. This means, it will still match
\&'ap'.
.SS "11.25. How can I use '/' within a pattern, without escaping it?"
.IX Subsection "11.25. How can I use '/' within a pattern, without escaping it?"
When using / to search for a pattern, you need to escape all '/' within
the pattern, because they would otherwise terminate the pattern. So you
can't directly search for /usr/share/doc/ but need to search for
\&\e/usr\e/share\e/doc\e/
.PP
The easiest solution around that, would be to use '?' to start a
backward search and afterwards use /<\s-1CR\s0> to use the last search-pattern
in forward direction.
.PP
If you have a Vim, that has the eval-feature built in (which needs at
least a normal built or higher), you can also directly paste the pattern
into the search register:

:let @/ = '/usr/share/doc/'

The 'gn' command makes it easy to operate on regions of text that match
the current search pattern. By default, it will search forward for the
last used search pattern and visually select the match. If the cursor is
already on the match, it will be visually selected. If you used the 'gn'
command after an operator (e.g. 'c' to change text), it will be applied
on the match.
.PP
If Visual mode is active before using gn, the visual selection will be
extended until the end of the next match.
.PP
The 'gN' commands works similar but searches backwards.
.PP
This allows to repeat simple operations on each match. For example, you
might want to change each occurence of apples by peaches. So you search
using '/apple' then you can use 'cgnpeach<esc>' to replace the current
match by peach. Now you can use the dot '.' command to redo the
replacement for the rest of the buffer.

You can specify a motion command with the yank operator (y) to yank text
from one position to another position within a line. For example, to yank
from the current cursor position till the next letter x, use yfx or Fx or
tx or Tx. To yank till the nth column, use n|. To yank till the next
occurrence of a 'word', use /word. To do a yank till the nth column on

You can use the \*(L":global\*(R" command to yank all the lines containing the
pattern into a register and then paste the contents of the register into
the buffer:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& :let @a=\*(Aq\*(Aq
\& :g/mypattern/y A
.Ve
.PP
The first command, clears the contents of the register \*(L"a\*(R". The second
command copies all the lines containing \*(L"mypattern\*(R" into the register \*(L"a\*(R".
Note that the capital letter \*(L"A\*(R" is used to append the matched lines. Now
you can paste the contents of register \*(L"a\*(R" to a buffer using "ap command.
.PP
If you only want to collect all matches, you can use a different
approach. For that run the ':s' command with the flags 'gn' so that it
won't actually  change the buffer ('n' flag) but select each match ('g'
flag). Combining this with the '\e=' part in the replacement part, you
can copy each match to e.g. a list. Altogether this looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& :let list=[]
\& :%s/pattern/\e=add(list, submatch(0))/gn

.IX Subsection "14.14. When I paste some text into a Vim buffer from another application, the alignment (indentation) of the new text is messed up. How do I fix this?"
When you paste text into a \s-1GUI\s0 Vim using the mouse, Vim is able to
detect that you are pasting text. So all the indentation related
settings (like autoindent, smartindent, cindent, etc.) are ignored and
the text is pasted literally.
.PP
When pasting text into a Vim running in a terminal (like xterm) using
the mouse, Vim may not be able to detect that you are pasting text. This
depends on several things: the capability of the terminal to pass the
mouse events to Vim, Vim is compiled to handle mouse events and access
the clipboard, the \s-1DISPLAY\s0 variable is set properly, the Vim 'mouse'
option is set correctly.
.PP
If Vim is able to detect that you are pasting text using the mouse, then
the pasted text will be inserted literally.
.PP
If Vim is not able to detect that you are pasting using the mouse, then
it will see the pasted text as though you literally typed the text.
After the first line from the pasted text is inserted, when Vim
encounters the newline character, because of the indentation settings,
the next line will start indented. The spaces at the beginning of the
second line in the pasted text will be inserted leading to additional
indentation. This will be repeated for subsequent lines. So the pasted
text will be inserted with stair case indentation.
.PP
You can fix this problem in a terminal Vim in several ways:
.PP
1. Build Vim with the +mouse and +xterm_clipboard compile-time options.
   The normal or big or huge build of Vim includes these options.  Set
   the 'mouse' option to either 'a' or include 'i'.  When pasting text
   using the mouse, don't press the Shift key. This will work only if
   Vim can access the X display. For more information, read the
   following Vim help topics:
.PP
\&\fB:help +feature\-list\fR
.PP
\&\fB:help 'mouse'\fR
.PP
\&\fB:help <MiddleMouse\fR>
.PP
\&\fB:help x11\-selection\fR
.PP
\&\fB:help xterm-clipboard\fR
.PP
1.1 Some Linux distributions build their terminal vim packages
 without X support.  This makes no sense and leaves many users
 with the impression that Vim in terminal mode doesn't support
 some operations such as properly pasting text with a mouse.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& If your distribution includes gvim, which it almost certainly
\& does these days, the solutions to this include the following.
\&
\& a)  Start Vim as
\&
\&         gvim \-v
\&
\& b)  Put this alias in your shell\*(Aqs configuration file, e.g.
\&     ~/.bashrc:
\&
\&         alias vim=\*(Aqgvim \-v\*(Aq
\&
\& c)  Put the following command in a file named \*(Aqvim\*(Aq and put that
\&     file in your ~/bin directory:
\&
\&         gvim \-v "$@"
\&
\& d)  Link the distribution\*(Aqs gvim to ~/bin/vim with the following
\&     command, which needs to be executed only once.
\&
\&         ln \-s $(which gvim) ~/bin/vim
\&
\& For c) and d), make sure that ~/bin precedes /usr/bin in your
\& PATH.
.Ve
.PP
2. Paste the text using the CTRL-R CTRL-O * command.  This will paste
   the text literally without any automatic indentation. If you want to
   paste the text and then fix the indentation, then you can use CTRL-R
   CTRL-P *. These commands will work only if Vim can access the X
   display. For more information, read the following Vim help topics:
.PP
\&\fB:help i_CTRL\-R_CTRL\-O\fR
.PP
\&\fB:help i_CTRL\-R_CTRL\-P\fR
.PP
\&\fB:help quotestar\fR
.PP
3. Set the 'paste' option before pasting the text. This option will
   disable the effect of all the indentation related settings. Make
   sure to turn off this option using ':set nopaste' after pasting the
   text. Otherwise the Vim indentation feature will not work.  Do not
   permanently set the 'paste' option in your .vimrc file. If you are
   going to repeat these steps often, then you can set the
   'pastetoggle' option to a key. When you press the specified key,
   the 'paste' option will be toggled. You can press the key once
   before pasting the text and the press the key once after pasting
   the text. Note that when the 'paste' option is set, all the
   mappings and abbreviations are disabled.  For more information,

This is normal behavior. If your window flashes, then you've got the visual
bell on. Otherwise, you should hear a beep.
.PP
Vim needs a timeout to tell the difference between a simple escape and,
say, a cursor key sequence.  When you press a key in normal mode (and even
in insert mode) and that key is the beginning of a mapping, Vim waits a
certain amount of time to see if the rest of the mapping sequence follows.
If the mapping sequence is completed before a given timeout period, the
mapping for that sequence of keys is applied. If you interrupt the mapping,
the normal actions associated with the keys are executed.
.PP
For example, if you have a mapping defined as \*(L":imap vvv Vim is great!!\*(R"
and you type \*(L"vvv\*(R" quickly, the \*(L"Vim is great!!\*(R" will be inserted into your
text. But if you type \*(L"vv v\*(R" then that is what will put into your text.
This is also true if you type \*(L"vvv\*(R" too slowly where \*(L"too slowly\*(R" is longer
than the value for the timeout option. Setting the timeout option to a
larger value can help alleviate problems that appear when using function
keys over a slow line.

1) First make sure, the key is passed correctly to Vim. To determine if
   this is the case, put Vim in Insert mode and then hit Ctrl-V (or
   Ctrl-Q if your Ctrl-V is remapped to the paste operation (e.g. on
   Windows if you are using the mswin.vim script file) followed by your
   key.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&   If nothing appears in the buffer (and assuming that you have
\&   \*(Aqshowcmd\*(Aq on, ^V remains displayed near the bottom right of the Vim
\&   screen), then Vim doesn\*(Aqt get your key correctly and there is nothing
\&   to be done, other than selecting a different key for your mapping or
\&   using GVim, which should recognise the key correctly.
.Ve
.PP
2) Possibly, Vim gets your key, but sees it as no different than
   something else. Say you want to map Ctrl-Right, then in Insert mode
   hit Ctrl-K followed by Ctrl-Right. If Vim displays <C\-Right> it has
   correctly seen the keystroke and you should be able to map it (by
   using <C\-Right> as your {lhs}). If it displays <Right> it has seen
   the keystroke but as if you hadn't held Ctrl down: this means your
   temrinal passes Ctrl-Right as if it were just <Right>. Anything else
   means the key has been misidentified.
.PP
3) If the key is seen, but not as itself and not as some recognizable
   key, then there is probably an error in the terminal library for the
   current terminal (termcap or terminfo database). In that case
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     :set term?
\&
\&   will tell you which termcap or terminfo Vim is using. You can try to
\&   tell vim, what termcode to use in that terminal, by adding the
\&   following to your vimrc:
\&
\&     if &term == <termname>
\&         set <C\-Right>=<keycode>
\&     endif
\&
\&   where <termname> above should be replaced by the value of \*(Aqterm\*(Aq
\&   (with quotes around it) and <keycode> by what you get when hitting
\&   Ctrl\-V followed by Ctrl\-Right in Insert mode (with nothing around
\&   it). <C\-Right> should be left as\-is (9 characters). Don\*(Aqt forget that
\&   in a :set command, white space is not allowed between the equal sign
\&   and the value, and any space, double quote, vertical bar or backslash
\&   present as part of the value must be backslash\-escaped.
\&
\&   Now you should be able to see the keycode corresponding to the key
\&   and you can create a mapping for the key using the following command:

The only Ctrl-printable-key chords which Vim can reliably detect (because they
are defined in the \s-1ASCII\s0 standard) are the following:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&     Ctrl\-@                 0x00            NUL

.Ve
.PP
Most of these, however, already have a function in Vim (and some are
aliases of other keys: Ctrl-H and Bsp, Ctrl-I and Tab, Ctrl-M and Enter,
Ctrl\-[ and Esc, Ctrl\-? and Del).
.PP
The \*(L"safest\*(R" keys to use in Vim for the {lhs} of a mapping are the F
keys, with or without Shift: <F2> to <F12> and <S\-F1> to <S\-F12>. (Some
OSes, including mine, intercept Ctrl-Fn and Alt-Fn, which never reach an
application program such as vim or gvim).
.PP
You can try other combinations of Ctrl + any key, but they may either
not work everywhere (e.g. the terminal might not pass that key to Vim,
or they might have unintended side effects (e.g. mapping <C\-I> means
also to map <Tab>).
.PP
This is a known issue, that has been discussed and might be implemented
in the future to enable Vim to distinguish between various keys even in
console mode. (e.g.

You can the \*(L":vmap\*(R" command to map a key in the visual mode. In the mapped
command sequence, you have to first yank the text. The yanked text is
available in the '\*(L"' register. Now, you can use the contents of this
register to run the external command. For example, to run the external
command \*(R"perldoc" on a visually selected text, you can use the following
mapping:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :vmap <F7> y:!exec "!perldoc \*(Aq" . @" . "\*(Aq"<CR>

If you want the mapping to work in the visual mode, but not with the

The above mapping will use the word under the cursor instead of the

external command. The <C\-U> is used to erase the range of text selected in
the visual mode and displayed on the command line. If the visual range is
not removed using <C\-U>, then the output from the external command will

.IX Subsection "20.20. How can I make my normal mode mapping work from within Insert Mode?"
Mappings in normal mode can be executed after <Ctrl\-O> from insert mode as
well but if there are more commands included in the mapping {rhs}, only the
first one will be executed in normal mode and the rest of {rhs} will be
printed literally in insert mode. One of ways to workaround this problem is
to make {rhs} be one command, via wrapping it to the function. For example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\& function GetFontNameOfFirstChar()
\& normal! 0
\& echo getfontname()
\& endfunction
\&
\& :nmap <F9> :call GetFontNameOfFirstChar()<CR>
.Ve
.PP
A more technical and detailed solution to this problem follows and can
be found at http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/msg/75f1f2dfc00908bb
.PP
Not every normal mode-mapping is automatically suitable for execution via
<Ctrl\-O> from within insert mode; you need to explicitly design your mappings
for that purpose.
.PP
The <Ctrl\-O> command allows execution of one normal mode command from
within insert mode, then returns to insert mode. If a normal mode mapping
concatenates multiple normal mode commands, this breaks down in temporary
normal mode and literally inserts the second part of the command into the
buffer instead. To support execution of normal mode mappings from within
insert mode, these strategies can be used:
.PP
1) Instead of concatenating multiple normal mode commands, use one :normal
 mapping:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :nnoremap <silent> zC :<C\-U>normal! zCVzC<CR>
.Ve
.PP
2) Concatenate multiple Ex commands via <Bar> on the rhs:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :nnoremap zC :<C\-U>call MyMap1()<Bar>call MyMap2()<CR>
.Ve
.PP
3) Shadow normal mode mappings by insert mode mappings that
 re-enter normal mode, then invoke the normal mode mapping:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& :nnoremap <silent> <SID>MyMap2 :<C\-U>call MyMap2()<CR>
\& :inoremap <silent> <script> <SID>MyMap2 <C\-\e><C\-O><SID>MyMap2
\& :nnoremap <silent> <script> zC <SID>MyMap1<SID>MyMap2
.Ve
.PP
4) Normal mode mappings that consist of multiple Ex command lines (and
 where Ex commands cannot be concatenated via <Bar>) replace ':<C\-U>'
 with <\s-1SID\s0>\s-1NM\s0; the <\s-1SID\s0>\s-1NM\s0 mapping enters normal mode for one ex command
 line:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& :nnoremap <silent> <SID>NM :<C\-U>
\& :inoremap <silent> <SID>NM <C\-\e><C\-O>:
\& :nnoremap <silent> <script> zC <SID>MyMap1<SID>NMcall MyMap2()<CR>
.Ve
.PP
5)  If none of the above is possible, at least force normal mode for
 subsequent commands via <CTRL\-\e><\s-1CTRL\-N\s0> to avoid accidental insertion
 of the remainder of the mapping.

Register 0 contains the text from the last yank operation. In your recorded

the yanked text. So your recording stored in register 0 is lost. You have

Vim doesn't read the whole file to parse the text for syntax highlighting.
It starts parsing wherever you are viewing the file. That saves a lot of
time, but sometimes the colors are wrong. A simple fix is refreshing the

Yes. Vim includes the matchparen Plugin as standard plugin that is enabled
by default. Whenever the cursor moves over an item defined with the
\&'matchpairs' option, Vim will highlight the corresponding bracket using the
MatchParen highlighting group.
.PP
However, if the corresponding parenthesis is not visible in the current
window, the cursor won't jump to it.

The matchit plugin provides a similar function, that lets the cursor
jump to related items (e.g. \*(L"if\*(R", \*(L"else\*(R", \*(L"endif\*(R" items) and skips
matches in comments. This uses the % command to jump to corresponding
items. Though both plugins provide similar functions they are unrelated

You can create filetype plugins to set different options for different
types of files. You should first enable filetype plugins using the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& :filetype plugin on
.Ve
.PP
A filetype plugin is a vim script that is loaded whenever Vim opens or
creates a file of that type.  For example, to ensure that the 'textwidth'
option is set to 80 when editing a C program (filetype 'c'), create one of
the following files:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&     ~/.vim/ftplugin/c.vim (Unix)
\&     %HOME%\evimfiles\eftplugin\ec.vim (Windows)
.Ve
.PP
with the following text in it:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&     setlocal textwidth=80
.Ve

You can also use autocommands to set specific options when editing specific
type of files. For example, to set the 'textwidth' option to 75 for only
*.txt files, you can use the following autocmd:

You can place the Vim runtime files (plugins, syntax files, indent files,
color schemes, filetype plugins, etc) under one of the directories
specified in the 'runtimepath' option. To determine the current value of

after/ directory in any of the 'runtimepath' directories.
.PP
\&\- for small changes to be done after (and in addition to) what is
  already done by the ftplugin installed with Vim, use an after-directory,
  as follows (replacing foobar by the 'filetype' of the concerned
  files):
.PP
.Vb 7
\& \- For changes private to one user:
\&     \- on Windows:
\&         $HOME/vimfiles/after/ftplugin/foobar.vim

\& \- For changes affecting all users on the system:

.Ve
.PP
\&\- when replacing the whole filetype-plugin by a different version, or
  when installing a new ftplugin for some filetype not yet supported by
  Vim out of the box: use the same paths without the after/ in them. In
  that case you should place near the start of your plugin an \*(L"if...
  finish... endif... let\*(R" block like the one in the plugins distributed
  with Vim.
.PP
All the above paths are given in Vim terminology (which is similar to
Unix terminology, but is understood even by Vim for Windows); they don't
exist by default, so the first time you need them you will have to
create them using mkdir (on any \s-1OS\s0 including DOS/Windows) or md (on
DOS/Windows only). \f(CW$VIM\fR and, on DOS/Windows, \f(CW$HOME\fR, do not necessarily
exist outside Vim. If \f(CW$HOME\fR has no value (or no valid value) inside Vim,
you can use \f(CW$VIM\fR instead; but on any but possibly very old versions of
Windows, \f(CW$HOMEDRIVE\fR and \f(CW$HOMEPATH\fR are defined by the system, and if
\&\f(CW$HOME\fR is undefined at Vim startup, Vim will set it by expanding
\&\f(CW$HOMEDRIVE\fR$HOMEPATH before sourcing your vimrc. To know which values Vim
uses, you can type (in a running Vim):
.PP
.Vb 2
\& :echo $VIM
\& :echo $HOME
.Ve
.PP
If you placed the file in the after/ftplugin runtime directory, then Vim
will first source the existing filetype plugin file and then will source
the new file.  If you placed the file in the \f(CW$VIMRTUNTIME\fR/ftplugin runtime
directory, then Vim will first source the new file and then will source the
existing filetype plugin file.

.IX Subsection "27.7. When editing files and when inserting new lines above or below a comment (//) line, Vim automatically inserts the comment character (//) at the beginning of the line. How do I disable this?"
This automatic insertion of the comment leader (//) when new lines
are added is controlled by three flags in the 'formatoptions'
option:  'c', 'r' and 'o'.  'c' enables auto-wrapping of comment
lines when typing extends beyond the right margin.  'r' enables the
automatic insertion of the comment leader when <Enter> is pressed
while editing a comment line.  'o' enables the automatic insertion
of the comment leader when a new line is opened above or below an
existing comment line by typing O or o in Normal mode.
.PP
You can stop Vim from automatically inserting the comment leader
when typing <Enter> within a comment or when opening a new line by
removing the 'r' and 'o' flags from 'formatoptions'.

The default filetype plugin for C and \*(C+ files
($VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/c.vim) adds the 'r' and 'o' flags to the

You can use the following command to edit a header file with the same name
as the corresponding C source file:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
You can use the following command to edit the file in a new split window:

.PP
In the above commands, the percent sign expands to the name of the current
file.  The \*(L":t\*(R" modifier extracts the tail (last component) of the
filename. The \*(L":r\*(R" modifier extracts the root of the filename.  The .h is
appended to the resulting name to get the header filename.
.PP
Another approach is to use the following command:

Starting from Vim 7.4.858 Vim provides the new commands :cfdo, :cdo,
:lfdo and :ldo. They work by iterating over all items in the quickfix
list and performing a command on each. The difference is, that the :lfdo
and :ldo commands iterate over the location list entries, while the
:cfdo and :cdo commands operate on the items in the quickfix list. Also,
the :cfdo and :lfdo operate on all different files, while the :cdo and
:ldo commands operate on each item in the quickfix/location list.
.PP
For example you could vimgrep all C files in the current directory for a
search string \*(L"Foobar\*(R":
.PP

Subject: Re: Terminal into vim, best options???
From: Nico Raffo
To: vim_use
.PP
There are quite a few options out there, all with their strengths and
weaknesses. Shell integration is at the top of the Vim wish list. I'm
sure Bram would be more interested in including it if someone
developed and maintained a kick-ass patch :\-)
.PP
Here is a (quite biased) overview of what's currently available:
.PP
Conque Shell
\&\s-1URL:\s0 http://code.google.com/p/conque/
Author: Nico Raffo (me!)
Requirements: *nix, python-enabled vim
Type: Plugin
.PP
Conque is a Vim plugin, written with Vim script and python. It turns
your Vim buffer into a terminal emulator. In \s-1INSERT\s0 mode your buffer
behaves like a standard unix terminal. In \s-1NORMAL\s0 mode you can navigate/
search/page through the terminal output.
.PP
Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Near complete \s-1VT100\s0 support (you can run emacs in a vim buffer)
 * Use of Vim features in terminal, including syntax highlighting,
   copy/paste, etc
 * Active development
.PP
Cons:
 * No Windows support (coming with Vim 7.3)
 * Can be slow, especially with programs which use a lot of terminal
   colors
.PP
Vimshell
\&\s-1URL:\s0 http://github.com/Shougo/vimshell + http://github.com/Shougo/vimproc
Author: Shougo M
Requirements: Works on both *nix and Windows. One small, independent
component may need to be compiled from C source.
Type: Plugin
.PP
Vimshell is a shell, written in the Vim scripting language, that runs
in a Vim buffer. The shell was written to take full advantage of all
of Vim's features, for example you can use Vim's omnicomplete
features, or any other normal mode Vim commands, to edit your command
line. Great potential, but missing a few features, particularly
regarding interactive programs.
.PP
Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Edit the command line with Vim, full use of Vim features in both
   normal and insert mode
 * Very fast, since there is no background process required
 * Windows support
 * Active development
.PP
Cons:
 * Very limited support of interactive programs such as bash, mysql or
   python.
 * Shell has incomplete functionality compared to bash, etc.
 * Documentation only available in Japanese.
.PP
screen.vim (Vim + screen/tmux)
\&\s-1URL:\s0 http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711
Author: Eric Van Dewoestine
Requirements: *nix
Type: Plugin
.PP
screen.vim is a Vim plugin which streamlines and enhances the
experience of running split screen terminal with Vim running in one of
the windows and a terminal running in the other. It uses the programs
screen or tmux to manage the split windows and to run the terminal
emulation. Both of these programs are very mature, and will give a
better terminal experience than any other option. However since the
terminal is running independently of Vim, you won't be able to use Vim
commands to interact with the terminal output.
.PP
Pros:
 * Easy to install
 * Great shell support
 * Active development
.PP
Cons:
 * No use of Vim commands to manage the shell window
 * Relatively little integration between Vim and the shell
.PP
Vim-Shell
\&\s-1URL:\s0 http://www.wana.at/vimshell/
Author: Thomas Wanda
Requirements: *nix, patch and recompile Vim from source
Type: Extension
.PP
Vim-Shell is a Vim extension which converts a buffer into a terminal
emulator. The shell window itself is very fast and functionality is
very strong. It is works great for running complex interactive
programs. However the Vim buffer where it runs is no longer editable
(you can't scroll up, or even move the cursor). The last official
release was for Vim 7.0, although time spent searching on Google will
turn up patches for Vim 7.1 and 7.2.
.PP
Pros:
 * Near complete \s-1VT100\s0 support (you can run emacs in a vim buffer, and
   just about anything else)
 * Very fast. Compiled into the C source
.PP
Cons:
 * Relatively difficult to install
 * No use of Vim features to navigate terminal output
 * No Windows or Mac support.
 * No development activity since 2006
.PP
Vimsh
\&\s-1URL:\s0 http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=165
Author: Brian Sturk
Requirements: python-enabled vim
Type: Plugin
.PP
Vimsh is a Vim plugin which allows you to run interactive programs in
a vim buffer. It provides a nice option for Windows use, but
functionality is overall less mature than the other options.
.PP
Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Use Vim commands to edit commands and navigate terminal output
 * Support in both *nix and Windows (no interactive programs in
   Windows)
.PP
Cons:
 * Limited functionality
 * Inactive development

The way Vim is designed, the cursor position has to be in a visible spot in
normal, visual, select and insert mode. This cannot be changed without
modifying Vim. When the scrollbar is used, the cursor will be moved so that
it is always visible. Another approach to solving this problem is to use
the Vim marks. You can mark the current cursor position using ma. Then
scroll to a different part of the text and jump back to the old position
using `a. You can also try the following suggestion from the Vim Online

This is a known problem. When you are splitting the Vim window, Vim will
try to draw a scrollbar. Since this changes the gui window, Vim tries to

Many terminal emulators and real terminal drivers use the CTRL-S key to

to look at it (also allowed older terminals to slow down the computer so
that it did not get buffer overflows).  You can start the output again by

This may be related to Vim opening the X display for setting the xterm

point to the correct host. Try using the command line:
.PP
.Vb 1

This will prevent Vim from opening the X display. With this command-line
option, the X clipboard cannot be used and also Vim will not be able to
change the xterm title.

You can also set the 'clipboard' option to
.PP
.Vb 1

If the clipboard is not the cause of the slow startup, it might be a

argument to debug this further. You can do:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ vim \-\-startuptime vim_startup.log
.Ve
.PP
and the timing will be written to the file vim_startup.log. For even
more advanced profiling, you can use the profiling feature, that is
available in huge builds of Vim. To do so, call Vim like this:
.PP
.Vb 6
\& $ vim \-\-cmd \*(Aqprofile start profile.log\*(Aq \e
\&   \-\-cmd \*(Aqprofile func *\*(Aq \e
\&   \-\-cmd \*(Aqprofile file *\*(Aq \e

The easiest and simplest way to get Vim syntax highlighting is to use the
\&\s-1GUI\s0 version of Vim (\s-1GVIM\s0). To get syntax highlighting to work in the
console/terminal version of Vim, you have to run a terminal emulator (like
Xfree86 xterm or rxvt or dtterm) that supports color. Note that if a
terminal emulator supports changing the background and foreground colors,
that does not mean that it also supports \s-1ANSI\s0 escape sequences for changing
the color. You can download the latest version of Xfree86 xterm from
http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html. You can download the latest version
of rxvt from http://www.rxvt.org. You have to install the terminfo/termcap
file that supports colors for the terminal emulator. Also, set the \s-1TERM\s0
environment variable to the correct name of the term that supports colors.
.PP
You can use the colortest.vim script supplied with the Vim runtime
package to test the color setup. To use this script, follow these steps:

You should first check, that you are actually running your self compiled
Vim and not the system's provided version. So first check your \f(CW$PATH\fR
setting.
.PP
Depending on your compile options, some features might not be included in
your build of Vim. You can use the \*(L":version\*(R" command to determine the Vim
features that are enabled at compile time. The features that are enabled
will be prefixed with a \*(L"+\*(R". The features that are not enabled will be
prefixed with a \*(L"\-\*(R".
.PP
The easiest way to include all features is to build the huge version. To do
this, you have to specify the \-\-with\-features option while running the
configure script:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ ./configure \-\-with\-features=huge
.Ve
.PP
Nevertheless, a feature could still be disabled at compile time, if the
configure script can't find the required libraries for those features (e.g.
for clipboard integration, your Vim needs to be linked against the X11
development libraries).
.PP
There are several ways to install the required libraries:
.PP
1) On a Debian based distribution, you can use the package manager \*(L"apt\*(R"
   to install all required dependencies. As superuser, run the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $ apt\-get build\-dep vim\-gtk
\&
\&   This makes sure all required libraries needed to compile the vim\-gtk
\&   package will be installed. (This requires, that your sources list
\&   contains deb\-src entries. See your distribution manual on how to
\&   enable this, if the above command did not work.)
.Ve
.PP
2) In openSUSE you can use the package manager \*(L"zypper\*(R" to install all
   required libraries. This requires, that there is a source version of
   the package installable from a configured repository (which by
   default is not the case). Use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $ zypper search \-t srcpackage vim
\&
\&   to find out, whether or not there exists a source version in the
\&   repository. If there is none, you\*(Aqll need to add a source repository.
\&   For openSUSE 11.2 you could use, e.g.
\&   
\&   $ zypper ar
\&   http://download.opensuse.org/source/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/src\-11.2
\&
\&   (one line)
\&
\&   Once you have a source version available in your repositories, use
\&   this command to install all needed requirements:
\&
\&   $ zypper source\-install \-\-build\-deps\-only vim
.Ve
.PP
3) On a Fedora/RedHat based system, you can use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $ yum\-builddep vim\-enhanced
.Ve
.PP
4) Run configure with your options and watch for missing libraries:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&   $ ./configure \-\-with\-features=huge 2>&1 |tee logfile
\&
\&   This will run configure and record the output into the file "logfile".
\&   You need to check the logfile for missing dependencies. Consider this
\&   output:
\&
\& checking \-\-disable\-gtktest argument... gtk test enabled
\& checking for pkg\-config... /usr/bin/pkg\-config
\& checking for GTK \- version >= 2.2.0... no
\&
\& Here you can see, that the gtk libraries are missing and therefore
\& no GTK gui version can\*(Aqt be build. So you need to install the GTK
\& library in your system, with your package manager or by compiling it
\& yourself. Then run the configure script again and check, that it
\& finds the library.
.Ve
.PP
In theory, those provided dependencies by your distribution might still
lack some libraries, that are needed for features, that simply are not
enabled in your distribution and therefore those commands in 1\-3 won't
install it. At the very least, this provides a jumping point and you need
to track down the required missing packages using method 4 from above. But
usually, this works good enough for most people and you won't have to
bother with the fourth method.

options to specify a group of commands:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ vim \-c "<ex_command_1>" \-c "<ex_command_2>" *.txt
.Ve
.PP
Each of the ex-command specified with the \*(L"\-c\*(R" command line option is

.Vb 1
\& $ vim \-c "<ex_command_1> | <ex_command_2>" *.txt
.Ve
.PP
In the above command, if an ex command fails, then all the remaining ex
commands will not be executed.
.PP
For example, to replace \*(L"\s-1ABC\*(R"\s0 with \*(L"\s-1DEF\*(R"\s0 in a file from the command-line,
you can use the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& $ vim \-c "%s/ABC/DEF/ge | update" myfile.txt

.PP
When running Vim in an xterm, you can either let Vim control the mouse
or let xterm control the mouse. This is configured by the 'mouse' option.
.PP
If the 'mouse' option is not set (or set to the default value), then Vim will
not control the mouse. You cannot move the Vim text cursor using the
mouse. When you select some text using the mouse, xterm will copy
it to the X11 cut buffer. When you press both the mouse buttons,
xterm will paste the text from the cut buffer.
.PP
If the 'mouse' option is set to 'a' or some other value, then Vim controls
the mouse. The mode (normal or insert or visual, etc) in which Vim
controls the mouse is configured by the 'mouse' option. You can move
the Vim text cursor using the mouse. When you select some text,
the 'clipboard' option setting is used to determine whether to transfer
the selected text to the clipboard or not. The default setting is to
transfer the selected text to the clipboard. If you want to use the
xterm selection mechanism in this mode, then you can press the
<Shift> key. If you press <Shift> key when selecting text using the
mouse, then Vim doesn't control the mouse and xterm controls the

When Vim opens a file, it checks it against the encodings listed in

.IX Subsection "37.8. What is the 'termencoding' option?"
The 'termencoding' option defines how your keyboard encodes the data you
type.  If empty, Vim assumes that it has the same value as 'encoding'.
Usually it should be set to something that matches your locale.

.SS "37.9. What is the 'bomb' option?"
.IX Subsection "37.9. What is the 'bomb' option?"
When reading a file with \*(L"ucs-bom\*(R" present in the 'fileencodings' option,
Vim will set the 'bomb' option on or off depending on the presence or
absence of a byte-order mark at the start of the file. When writing, Vim
will write a byte-order mark if the 'bomb' option is set. You may set or
unset it manually do make Vim write, or not write, the b.o.m.

.SS "37.11. How can I insert Unicode characters into a file using Vim?"
.IX Subsection "37.11. How can I insert Unicode characters into a file using Vim?"
Several methods are available:
.PP
\&\- Characters present on your keyboard can be typed in the usual way, even
  those which require a \*(L"dead-key\*(R" prefix, like (for instance) the
  circumflex on French keyboards.
\&\- Characters for which a digraph is defined can be typed as two characters
  prefixed by <Ctrl\-K>.
\&\- If you have set the 'digraph' option, you can enter the characters for
  which a digraph is defined as <char1><\s-1BS\s0><char2>.
\&\- Any character can be entered by using a <Ctrl\-V> prefix (or <Ctrl\-Q> if
  <Ctrl\-V> is remapped to paste from the clipboard).

.SS "37.12. How can I know which digraphs are defined and for which characters?"
.IX Subsection "37.12. How can I know which digraphs are defined and for which characters?"
First set the 'encoding' option properly (for instance, to utf\-8), then use
the :digraphs command to list the currently defined digraphs.
.PP
Alternatively, the help file contains the complete set of all digraphs.
So you can easily search that list there.
