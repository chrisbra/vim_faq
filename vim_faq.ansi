[1mSECTION 1[m - [33mGENERAL INFORMATION[m


[1m1.1.[m [36mWhat is Vim?[m

Vim stands for Vi IMproved. It used to be Vi IMitation, but there are so
many improvements that a name change was appropriate. Vim is a text editor
which includes almost all the commands from the Unix program "Vi" and a lot
of new ones. All commands can be given with the keyboard. This has the
advantage that you can keep your fingers on the keyboard and your eyes on
the screen. For those who want it, there is mouse support and a GUI version
with scrollbars and menus.

Vim is an editor, not a word processor. A word processor is used mainly to
do layout of text. This means positioning it, changing the way it appears
on output. More often than not, the final document is meant to be printed
or typeset or what have you, in order to present it in a pleasing manner to
others. Examples of word processors are Microsoft Word, WordPerfect,
FrameMaker, and OpenOffice Writer.

An editor is simply for entering text. Any typesetting or laying out of the
document is secondary. With an editor, one's main concern is entering text,
not making the text look good. Examples of editors other than Vim and Vi
are Emacs, Crisp, Brief, TextMate and xedit.  And Notepad.

[1m1.2.[m [36mWho wrote Vim?[m

Most of Vim was written by Bram Moolenar, with contributions from too many
people to mention here. See "[36;1m:h[m credits" for a complete list.

Vim is based on Stevie, worked on by Tim Thompson, Tony Andrews and G.R.

[1m1.3.[m [36mIs Vim compatible with Vi?[m

Yes. Vim is very much compatible with Vi.  You can use the "-C"
command-line flag to start Vim in Vi compatible mode:

    $ vim -C

You can also use:

    $ vim -u NONE

You can also set the 'compatible' option to enable Vi compatibility:

A short summary of the improvements of Vim over vi is listed below.  The
list shows that Vim is a thoroughly modern and feature-packed editor.
Standard features of modern editors are implemented, and there is an equal
emphasis on general power-user features and features for programmers.

Features to modernise Vi:

  Multi-level undo
     Allows you to set the number of times you can undo your changes in a
     file buffer. You can also redo an undone change.
  Tabs, Multiple windows and buffers
     Each file can be displayed in its own window. You can move easily from
     one window to another. Each file opened during a Vim session also has
     an associated buffer and you can easily jump from one to the other.
     Also like any modern GUI, Vim supports opening several files in tabs.
  Flexible insert mode
     Vim allows you to use the arrow keys while in insert mode to move
     around in the file. No more hitting <Esc>, moving around, then hitting
     `i' or `a'.
  Macros
     Vim has a facility which allows you to record a sequence of typed
     characters and repeat them any number of times.
  Visual mode
     You can highlight sections of text and execute operations on this
     section of text only.
  Block operators
     Allow selection and highlighting of rectangular blocks of text in
     order do execute specific operations on them.
  Online help system
     You can easily find help on any aspect of using Vim. Help is displayed
     in its own window.
  Command-line editing and history
     History allows you to use the arrow keys to repeat or search for a
     command that has already been typed. Allows you to match the beginning
     of a command with the beginning of another similar command in the
     history buffer. You can also edit a command to correct typos or change
     a few values.
  Command line completion.
     Using the <Tab> key, you can complete commands, options, filenames,
     etc. as needed.
  Horizontal scrolling.
     Long lines can be scrolled horizontally (with or without the GUI).
  Unicode and internationalization improvements.
     Vim is able to edit files in unicode encoding and uses internally an
     utf-8 encoding. Additionally Vim can display text right to left oriented.

Advanced user features:

  Text formatting.
     With two keystrokes, you can format large sections of text, without
     the use of external programs.
  Completion in Insert mode
     Vim provides several different possibilities to complete your text. 
     For example Vim can complete words while you are typing, by matching
     the current word with other similar words in the file.
  Jump tags
     Just like in an internet browser, you can jump back to previous parts
     of the text you were editing, and then forward again.  Your brain is
     thus free to edit instead of navigate.
  Automatic commands
     Commands automatically executed when reading or writing a file,
     jumping to another buffer, etc.
  Viminfo
     Allows storing of the command line history, marks and registers in a
     file to be read on startup.  Therefore, you can recall old search
     patterns, macros, etc., in a new Vim session.
  Mouse support
     The mouse is supported in an xterm and for MS-DOS. It can be used to
     position the cursor, select the visual area, paste a register, etc.
  Graphical User Interface (GUI)
     There are several different graphical user interfaces available. 
     Also, it's very easy to add your own menus.  Of course, console vim is
     still supported, and very widely used.
  Scripting language
     Vim has a powerful scripting language so new commands can be created.
     You can also use Perl, Python, TCL and Ruby to achieve the same thing!
  Plugins
     Extra functionality implemented via vim commands (regular commands or
     the scripting language) that is automatically loaded on startup.
     Examples: file explorer, network editing.  More are being developed
     and shared on VimOnline all the time.
  Syntax highlighting for many programming languages
     Syntax highlighting for hundreds of programming languages is
     supported. Support for others can be added.
  Extended regular expressions
     Vim supports extended regular expressions which are similar in
     functionality to that of Perl regular expressions.
  Integrated Spell checking
     Spell checking has been integrated into Vim 
  Diff mode
     Vim can highlight the differences between two, three or four files.
     Identical lines will be folded away and hidden.
  Encryption using the blowfish algorithm
     Vim allows to encrypt your files using the symmetric block cipher
     blowfish as well as the swap file.
  Extensive customizable
     Vim can be tuned and customized to work like you want by setting
     options.  You can define your own commands, macros and even plugins
     to extend its capabilities

Programming performance features:

  Edit-compile-edit speedup
     You can compile within Vim and automatically jump to the location of
     errors in the source code.
  Indenting for many programming languages
     C, C++, Java, Perl, XML and many other languages can be automatically
     indented by vim while you type.  Support for others can be added.
  Searching for words in include files
     Vim allows you to search for a match of the word under the cursor in
     the current and included files.
  Advance text objects
     Instantly select, or delete, or copy, or indent, or format, or change
     case, or ... to all the text between ( and ), or { and }, or < and >,
     or [ and ].  Or a word, sentence, or paragraph.  Very powerful.
  Folding
     Certain parts of the text can be "folded" away.  The best example is
     the body of a function.  You can get an overview of the code, and then
     open the fold of the function whose detail you need to see.
  ctags and cscope integration
     Using these two powerful programs, you can jump to a definition of a
     function from a calling instance of it, and use other tricks to
     navigate source code.
  Integration of several programming languages
     If you find the internal scripting language not powerful enough, you
     can extend Vim using Lua, Ruby, Tcl, Perl and Python 2 and 3.

[1m2.1.[m [36mWhere can I learn more about Vim?[m

You can post your Vim questions to the vim@vim.org mailing list.  You can
post your Vim development related questions to the vim-dev@vim.org mailing
list. Vim does not have a newsgroup of its own. But the appropriate
newsgroup to post to is comp.editors.

"VimOnline" is a web page that serves as a de facto homepage for vim,
although the main purpose of it is to gather tips and scripts from
everywhere.  Get involved!  The URL is vim.sourceforge.net or vim.sf.net.

Finally, read the Vi FAQ:

    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/vi/part1/index.html

[1m2.2.[m [36mIs there a mailing list available?[m

There are several:

    NAME              DESCRIPTION

    vim-announce      Announcements of new releases
    vim               General discussion
    vim-dev           Patches, bug reports, development discussions
    vim-mac           Macintosh discussion
    vim-fr            General discussion in French
    vim-multibyte     Multibyte development issues
    vim-vms           Development on VMS

Of these, only vim and vim-dev are of general interest.  vim-announce is
read-only to most people, and its messages are sent to the other lists as
well.  The remaining four are very low volume.

To subscribe:   send an email to <NAME>-subscribe@vim.org
To unsubscribe: send an email to <NAME>-unsubscribe@vim.org
To get help:    send an email to <NAME>-help@vim.org


[1m2.3.[m [36mIs there an archive available for the Vim mailing lists?[m

Yes.  Visit http://www.yahoogroups.com/list/<name>, where name is one of:
vimannounce, vim, vimdev, vim-fr, vim-mac, vim-multibyte, vim-vms.

Alternatively, visit www.gmane.org to find out about GMANE, which allows
you to access the mailing lists as though they were newsgroups.  This
offers some convenience to those who wish to browse the history or casually
observe the current threads.


[1m2.4.[m [36mWhere can I get the Vim user manual in HTML/PDF/PS format?[m

You can download the HTML/PDF/PS format of the Vim user manual from:

    http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/


[1m2.5.[m [36mI have a "xyz" (some) problem with Vim. How do I determine it is a[m
     problem with my setup or with Vim?

First, you have to determine that the problem is not with your .vimrc or
[1m.[m [36mvimrc or system vimrc or your personal plugin files or in any of your[m
setup files. To do this, use

    $ vim -N -u NONE -U NONE

This will start Vim in 'nocompatible" mode and will not source your
personal .vimrc and .gvimrc files. It will also not load your personal
plugins. In this invocation of Vim, try to reproduce your problem. If you
are not able to reproduce the problem, then the problem is related to some
setting in one of your local setup files or plugins. To locate the problem
in your setup files, you have to use trial and error and try commenting out
the lines in your setup files one by one. You can also use the -V command
line argument to Vim to get more debug information and analyze the problem:

    $ vim -V2

You can increase the value passed to the -V argument to get more debug
information.

First collect the required information using the following command:

    [36;1m:source[m $VIMRUNTIME/bugreport.vim

Now send the resulting text from the above command to the bugs@vim.org
e-mail address.

The Vim Development mailing list (see above) is a good place to discuss
general bugs.  If the bug you find is with syntax highlighting or some
other "added feature" (i.e. not directly programmed into vim), attempt to
inform the maintainer of that feature.

[1m2.7.[m [36mWhere can the FAQ be found?[m

The FAQ can be found at http://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html.

A slightly older version (which doesn't seem to get updated anymore) can
still be found at VimOnline (vim.sf.net). Other places will be decided in
the future.


[1m2.8.[m [36mWhat if I don't find an answer in this FAQ?[m

This FAQ covers mainly Vim-specific questions. You may find more
information suitable for most Vi clones by reading the Vi FAQ. It is posted
regularly on comp.editors. You can also find a copy at

    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/editor-faq/vi/part1/index.html

Also, since Vim has gathered so many features in the last few years,
successfully documenting the frequently asked questions here is a
near-impossible task.  To make it possible, please email the maintainer if
you have a good question.  A good question is one that you've tried to
answer yourself (remember, Vim has great documentation) but struggled.


[1m2.9.[m [36mI have a patch for implementing a Vim feature. Where can I send this[m
     patch?

You can send your patches to the Vim developer mailing list
vim-dev@vim.org.

[1mSECTION 4[m - [33mHELP[m


[1m4.1.[m [36mHow do I use the help files?[m

Help can be found for all functions of Vim. In order to use it, use the
"[36;1m:help[m" command.  This will bring you to the main help page. On that first
page, you will find explanations on how to move around. Basically, you move
around in the help pages the same way you would in a read-only document.
You can jump to specific subjects by using tags. This can be done in two
ways:

   * Use the "<Ctrl-]>" command while standing on the name of a command or
     option. This only works when the tag is a keyword. "<Ctrl-LeftMouse>"
     and "g<LeftMouse>" work just like "<Ctrl-]>".
   * use the "[36;1m:tag[m <subject>" command. This works with all characters.

Use "<Ctrl-T>" to jump back to previous positions in the help files. Use
"[36;1m:q[m" to close the help window.

If you want to jump to a specific subject on the help pages, use "[36;1m:help[m
{subject}". If you don't know what to look for, try "[36;1m:help[m index" to get a
list of all available subjects. Use the standard search keys to locate the
information you want. You can abbreviate the "[36;1m:help[m" command as ":h".

For more information, read

    [36;1m:help[m online-help


[1m4.2.[m [36mHow do I search for a keyword in the Vim help files?[m

a)  You can press the CTRL-D key after typing the help keyword to get a
    list of all the help keywords containing the supplied pattern. You can
    also use the meta characters like *, \+, etc to specify the help
    search pattern:

    [36;1m:help[m init<C-D>
    [36;1m:help[m str*()<C-D>
    [36;1m:help[m '*indent<C-D>

b)  You can press the Tab key after typing a partial help keyword to expand
    to the matching keyword. You can continue to press the Tab key to see
    other keyword matches.

c)  From the help window, you can use the "[36;1m:tag[m" command to search for
    keywords. For example,

    [36;1m:tselect[m /window

    This command will list all the help keywords containing the text
    "window". You can select one from the list and jump to it.

d)  You can use the "[36;1m:helpgrep[m" command to search for the given text in all
    the help files. The quickfix window will be opened with all the
    matching lines.

You can get more information about the error and the error message using:

    [36;1m:help[m E123

For more information, read

    [36;1m:help[m error-messages


[1m4.4.[m [36mWhere can I read about the various modes in Vim?[m

You can get information about the different modes in Vim by reading

    [36;1m:help[m vim-modes


[1m4.5.[m [36mHow do I generate the Vim help tags file after adding a new Vim help[m
     file?

You can use the "[36;1m:helptags[m" command to regenerate the Vim help tag file.
For example:

    [36;1m:cd[m $VIMRUNTIME/doc
    [36;1m:helptags[m .

For more information, read

    [36;1m:help[m :helptags
    [36;1m:help[m add-local-help


[1m4.6.[m [36mCan I use compressed versions of the help files?[m

Yes. You can compress the help files and still be able to view them with
Vim.  This makes accessing the help files a bit slower and requires the
"gzip" utility. Follow these steps to compress and use the Vim help files:

- Compress all the help files using "gzip doc/*.txt".

- Edit the "doc/tags" file and change the ".txt" to ".txt.gz" using
        :%s=\(\t.*\.txt\)\t=\1.gz\t=

- Add the following line to your vimrc:
        set helpfile={dirname}/help.txt.gz

Where {dirname} is the directory where the help files are.  The gzip.vim
plugin supplied with the standard Vim distribution will take care of
decompressing the files.  You must make sure that $VIMRUNTIME is set to
where the other Vim files are, when they are not in the same location as
the compressed "doc" directory.

[1m9.3.[m [36mHow do I zoom into or out of a window?[m

You can zoom into a window (close all the windows except the current
window) using the "CTRL-W o" command or the "[36;1m:only[m" ex command.

You can use the "CTRL-W _" command or the "[36;1m:resize[m" ex command to increase
the current window height to the highest possible without closing other
windows.

You can use the "CTRL-W |" command or the "[36;1m:vertical[m resize" ex command to
increase the current window width to the highest possible without closing
other windows.

You can use the "CTRL-W =" command to make the height and width of all the
windows equal.

You can also set the following options to get better results with the above
commands:

Method 1:
Set the 'winminheight' option to 0:

    [36;1m:set[m winminheight=0

By default, this option is set to 1.
This option controls the minimum height of an inactive window (when it is
not the current window).  When the 'winminheight' option is set to 0, only
the status line will be displayed for inactive windows.

Method 2:
Set the 'noequalalways' option and set the 'winheight' option to a large
value (like 99999):

    [36;1m:set[m noequalalways
    [36;1m:set[m winheight=99999

Now, the active window will always open to its maximum size, while the
other windows will stay present, but shrunken to just a status line.

With any of the above mentioned methods, you cannot restore the window
layout after zooming into a window.  If you want to restore the Vim window
layout after zooming into a window, you can use the ZoomWin plugin. You can

[1m10.1.[m [36mHow do I jump to the beginning (first line) or end (last line) of a[m

[1m10.2.[m [36mIn insert mode, when I press the <Esc> key to go to command mode, the[m
     cursor moves one character to the left (except when the cursor is on
     the first character of the line). Is it possible to change this
     behavior to keep the cursor at the same column?

No. It is not possible to change this behavior. The cursor is *always*
positioned on a valid character (unless you have virtual-edit mode
enabled). So, if you are appending text to the end of a line, when you
return to command mode the cursor *must* drop back onto the last character
you typed. For consistency sake, the cursor drops back everywhere, even if
you are in the middle of a line.

You can use the CTRL-O or CTRL-\ CTRL-O command in insert mode to execute a
single ex command and return back to insert mode without moving the cursor
column.

     line on the screen. How do I move from one screen line to the next?

You can use the gj and gk commands to move from one screen line to the
next/previous screen line. The j and k commands move the cursor from one
file line to the next file line. You can also avoid the line wrapping by
resetting the 'wrap' option:

[1m10.5.[m [36mWhat is the definition of a sentence, paragraph and section in Vim?[m

A sentence is defined as ending at a '.', '!' or '?' followed by either the
end of a line, or by a space (or two) or tab. Which characters and the
number of spaces needed to constitute a sentence ending is determined by
the 'joinspaces' and 'cpoptions' options.

A paragraph begins after each empty line, and also at each of a set of
paragraph macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the 'paragraphs'
option.

A section begins after a form-feed (<C-L>) in the first column and at each
of a set of section macros, specified by the pairs of characters in the
'sections' option.

      motion  position    where
      (       beginning   current sentence
      )       end         current sentence

You can use one of the following commands to horizontally scroll the screen
to the left or right:

    zl - scroll to the left
    zh - scroll to the right
    zL - scroll half a screenwidth to the left
    zH - scroll half a screenwidth to the right
    zs - scroll to position the cursor at the start of the screen
    ze - scroll to position the cursor at the end of the screen

You can use the g0 command to move the cursor to the first character of the

[1m10.9.[m [36mWhen I use my arrow keys, Vim changes modes, inserts weird characters[m
     in my document but doesn't move the cursor properly. What's going on?

There are a couple of things that could be going on: either you are using
Vim over a slow connection or Vim doesn't understand the key sequence that
your keyboard is generating.

If you are working over a slow connection (such as a 2400 bps modem), you
can try to set the 'timeout' or 'ttimeout' option. These options, combined
with the 'timeoutlen' and 'ttimeoutlen' options, may fix the problem.

The preceding procedure will not work correctly if your terminal sends key
codes that Vim does not understand. In this situation, your best option is
to map your key sequence to a matching cursor movement command and save
these mappings in a file. You can then "[36;1m:source[m" the file whenever you work
from that terminal.

You can add the '<' flag to the 'whichwrap' option to configure Vim to move
the cursor to the end of the previous line, when the left arrow key is
pressed and the cursor is currently at the beginning of a line:

    [36;1m:set[m whichwrap+=<

Similarly, to move the cursor the beginning of the next line, when the
right arrow key is  pressed and the cursor is currently at the end of a
line, add the '>' flag to the 'whichwrap' option:

    [36;1m:set[m whichwrap+=>

[1m10.11.[m [36mHow do I configure Vim to stay only in insert mode (modeless[m

You can set the 'insertmode' option to configure Vim to stay only in insert
mode:

    [36;1m:set[m insertmode

By setting this option, you can use Vim as a modeless editor. If you press
the <Esc> key, Vim will not go to the normal mode. To execute a single
normal mode command, you can press CTRL-O followed by the normal mode
command.  To execute more than one normal command, you can use CTRL-L
followed by the commands. To return to insert mode, press the <Esc> key. To
disable this option, reset the 'insertmode' option:

    [36;1m:set[m noinsertmode

You can also start vim using the "evim" command or you can use "vim -y" to
use Vim as a modeless editor.

You can also start Vim in insert mode using the "[36;1m:startinsert[m" ex command.

using a collation [] like this:

    /[\d188]
    /[\o274]

World", you can use the following search command:

    /Hello\_sWorld

This will match the word "Hello" followed by a newline character and then
the word "World" at the beginning of the next line. This will also match
the word "Hello" immediately followed by a space character and then the
word "World". When searching for the "Hello World" string, to include the
space characters at the end and beginning of the line, you can use the
following search command:

    /Hello\_s\+World

You can exchange two characters with the "xp" command sequence. The 'x'
will delete the character under the cursor and 'p' will paste the just
deleted character after the character under the cursor. This will result
in exchanging the two characters.

You can exchange two words with the "deep" command sequence (start with the
cursor in the blank space before the first word).

You can exchange two lines with the "ddp" command sequence. The 'dd' will
delete the current line and 'p' will paste the just deleted line after the
current line. This will result in exchanging the two lines. 

All of the above operations will change the " unnamed register.

You can use the "[36;1m:m[m +" ex command to exchange two lines without changing the

       these helped. How can I hide these symbols?

When a file is loaded in Vim, the format of the file is determined as
below:

- If all the lines end with a new line (<NL>), then the fileformat is
  'unix'.
- If all the lines end with a carriage return (<CR>) followed by a new line
  (<NL>), then the fileformat is 'dos'.
- If all the lines end with carriage return (<CR>), then the fileformat is
  'mac'.

If the file has some lines ending with <CR> and some lines ending with <CR>
followed by a <NL>, then the fileformat is set to 'unix'.

You can change the format of the current file, by saving it explicitly in
dos format:

    [36;1m:w[m ++ff=dos

To display the format of the current file, use

    [36;1m:set[m fileformat?

The above behavior is also controlled by the 'fileformats' option. You can
try the following commands:

    [36;1m:set[m fileformats+=unix
    [36;1m:e[m <your_file>
    [36;1m:set[m fileformat=unix

To remove the carriage return (<CR>) character at the end of all the lines
in the current file, you can use the following command:

    :%s/\r$//

To force Vim to use a particular file format, when editing a file, you can
use the following command:

[1m14.14.[m [36mWhen I paste some text into a Vim buffer from another application,[m
      the alignment (indentation) of the new text is messed up. How do I
      fix this?

When you paste text into a GUI Vim using the mouse, Vim is able to
detect that you are pasting text. So all the indentation related
settings (like autoindent, smartindent, cindent, etc.) are ignored and
the text is pasted literally.

When pasting text into a Vim running in a terminal (like xterm) using
the mouse, Vim may not be able to detect that you are pasting text. This
depends on several things: the capability of the terminal to pass the
mouse events to Vim, Vim is compiled to handle mouse events and access
the clipboard, the DISPLAY variable is set properly, the Vim 'mouse'
option is set correctly.

If Vim is able to detect that you are pasting text using the mouse, then
the pasted text will be inserted literally.

If Vim is not able to detect that you are pasting using the mouse, then
it will see the pasted text as though you literally typed the text.
After the first line from the pasted text is inserted, when Vim
encounters the newline character, because of the indentation settings,
the next line will start indented. The spaces at the beginning of the
second line in the pasted text will be inserted leading to additional
indentation. This will be repeated for subsequent lines. So the pasted
text will be inserted with stair case indentation.

You can fix this problem in a terminal Vim in several ways:

[1m1.[m [36mBuild Vim with the +mouse and +xterm_clipboard compile-time options.[m
   The normal or big or huge build of Vim includes these options.  Set
   the 'mouse' option to either 'a' or include 'i'.  When pasting text
   using the mouse, don't press the Shift key. This will work only if
   Vim can access the X display. For more information, read the
   following Vim help topics:

[1m2.[m [36mPaste the text using the CTRL-R CTRL-O * command.  This will paste[m
   the text literally without any automatic indentation. If you want to
   paste the text and then fix the indentation, then you can use CTRL-R

   display. For more information, read the following Vim help topics:

[1m3.[m [36mSet the 'paste' option before pasting the text. This option will[m
   disable the effect of all the indentation related settings. Make sure
   to turn off this option using '[36;1m:set[m nopaste' after pasting the text.
   Otherwise the Vim indentation feature will not work.  Do not
   permanently set the 'paste' option in your .vimrc file. If you are
   going to repeat these steps often, then you can set the 'pastetoggle'
   option to a key. When you press the specified key, the 'paste' option
   option will be toggled. You can press the key once before pasting the
   text and the press the key once after pasting the text. Note that

To copy the output from an ex-command into a buffer, you have to first get
the command output into a register. You can use the "[36;1m:redir[m" command to get
the output into a register. For example,

    [36;1m:redir[m @a
    [36;1m:g[m/HelloWord/p
    [36;1m:redir[m END

Now the register 'a' will contain the output from the ex command
"g/HelloWord/p". Now you can paste the contents of the register 'a' into a
buffer. You can also send or append the output of an ex-command into a file
using the 'redir' command.

You can prefix the "[36;1m:global[m" command with ":silent", to avoid having the
lines printed to the screen.

To redirect the output from an ex-command to a file, you can use the
following set of commands:

[1m19.15.[m [36mWhy do I hear a beep (why does my window flash) about 1 second after[m
       I hit the Escape key?

This is normal behavior. If your window flashes, then you've got the visual
bell on. Otherwise, you should hear a beep.

Vim needs a timeout to tell the difference between a simple escape and,
say, a cursor key sequence.  When you press a key in normal mode (and even
in insert mode) and that key is the beginning of a mapping, Vim waits a
certain amount of time to see if the rest of the mapping sequence follows.
If the mapping sequence is completed before a given timeout period, the
mapping for that sequence of keys is applied. If you interrupt the mapping,
the normal actions associated with the keys are executed.

For example, if you have a mapping defined as "[36;1m:imap[m vvv Vim is great!!"
and you type "vvv" quickly, the "Vim is great!!" will be inserted into your
text. But if you type "vv v" then that is what will put into your text.
This is also true if you type "vvv" too slowly where "too slowly" is longer
than the value for the timeout option. Setting the timeout option to a
larger value can help alleviate problems that appear when using function
keys over a slow line.

The only Ctrl-printable-key chords which Vim can reliably detect (because they
are defined in the ASCII standard) are the following:

        Ctrl-@                 0x00            NUL
        Ctrl-A to Ctrl-Z       0x01 to 0x1A
        Ctrl-a to Ctrl-z       0x01 to 0x1A
        Ctrl-[                 0x1B            ESC
        Ctrl-\                 0x1C

        Ctrl-^                 0x1E

        Ctrl-?                 0x7F            DEL

Most of these, however, already have a function in Vim (and some are
aliases of other keys: Ctrl-H and Bsp, Ctrl-I and Tab, Ctrl-M and Enter,
Ctrl-[ and Esc, Ctrl-? and Del).

The "safest" keys to use in Vim for the {lhs} of a mapping are the F
keys, with or without Shift: <F2> to <F12> and <S-F1> to <S-F12>. (Some
OSes, including mine, intercept Ctrl-Fn and Alt-Fn, which never reach an
application program such as vim or gvim.)

Using "[36;1m:map[m" creates a mapping that works in normal, visual+select mode and
operator pending mode. You can use "[36;1m:nmap[m" to have the mapping only work in
normal mode and "[36;1m:vmap[m" to have the mapping only be defined for visual and

But if you want to have a mapping defined, that works in both operator
pending mode and normal mode, but not in visual and select mode, you need
to first define the mapping using "[36;1m:map[m" and afterwards delete the mapping

Vim uses most of the keys in the keyboard. You can use the <leader> prefix
in maps to define keys which will not overlap with Vim keys. For example:

    [36;1m:map[m <leader>S <C-W>s
    [36;1m:map[m <leader>j <C-W>j
    [36;1m:map[m <leader>k <C-W>k

where by default <leader> gets substituted with a backslash (\), so the
user would enter

        \s

        \k

to invoke the above map commands. The user can change the mapleader
variable to be whatever they wanted:

    [36;1m:let[m mapleader = ","

Make sure you have not defined a mapping for this key using the following
command:

    [36;1m:map[m <key>

If a mapping is defined for this key and the mapped key contains more than
one character, then Vim will wait for the next character to be pressed to
determine whether it is the mapped key or not. For example, if you have
mapped "ab", then if you press "a", Vim will wait for the next key to be
pressed. If the next key is "b", Vim will execute the mapped sequence.
Otherwise, Vim will proceed with the normal processing of "a" followed by
the next key. If the 'timeout' option is set (which is the default), then
Vim will timeout after waiting for the period specified with the
'timeoutlen' option (default is 1 second).

You can the "[36;1m:vmap[m" command to map a key in the visual mode. In the mapped
command sequence, you have to first yank the text. The yanked text is
available in the '"' register. Now, you can use the contents of this
register to run the external command. For example, to run the external
command "perldoc" on a visually selected text, you can use the following
mapping:

    [36;1m:vmap[m <F7> y:!exec "!perldoc '" . @" . "'"<CR>

If you want the mapping to work in the visual mode, but not with the
highlighted text, you can use the following command:

    [36;1m:vmap[m <F7> :<C-U>!perldoc <cword><CR>

The above mapping will use the word under the cursor instead of the
highlighted text. Note the use of the <C-U> before invoking the "perldoc"
external command. The <C-U> is used to erase the range of text selected in
the visual mode and displayed on the command line. If the visual range is
not removed using <C-U>, then the output from the external command will
replace the visually selected text.

      parts of the file is not syntax highlighted or syntax highlighted
      incorrectly.

Vim doesn't read the whole file to parse the text for syntax highlighting.
It starts parsing wherever you are viewing the file. That saves a lot of
time, but sometimes the colors are wrong. A simple fix is refreshing the
screen using the CTRL-L key. Or scroll back a bit and then forward again.
You can also use the command:

Note that this might considerably slow down the screen refreshing.

Yes. Vim includes the matchparen Plugin as standard plugin that is enabled

'matchpairs' option, the cursor will jump back to the corresponding
bracket.

However, this will only work, if the corresponding parenthesis is not
visible in the current window, the cursor won't jump to it.

In the above command, getline(".") returns  the text in the current line.
The indexing of the string starts at zero, and you can get a single

col(".") returns the column of the cursor position; the adjustment is to
get the right character of the string. However, this does NOT work with
multibyte characters as this command only returns the byte index.

[1m26.1.[m [36mHow do I set different options for different types of files?[m

You can create filetype plugins to set different options for different
types of files. You should first enable filetype plugins using the command:

    [36;1m:filetype[m plugin on

A filetype plugin is a vim script that is loaded whenever Vim opens or
creates a file of that type.  For example, to ensure that the 'textwidth'
option is set to 80 when editing a C program (filetype 'c'), create one of
the following files:

        ~/.vim/ftplugin/c.vim (Unix)
        %HOME%\vimfiles\ftplugin\c.vim (Windows)

with the following text in it:

        setlocal textwidth=80

You can also use autocommands to set specific options when editing specific
type of files. For example, to set the 'textwidth' option to 75 for only
*.txt files, you can use the following autocmd:

    autocmd BufRead *.txt setlocal textwidth=80

      these files so that Vim will find them?

You can place the Vim runtime files (plugins, syntax files, indent files,
color schemes, filetype plugins, etc) under one of the directories
specified in the 'runtimepath' option. To determine the current value of
the 'runtimepath' option, use the following command:

    [36;1m:set[m runtimepath

For Unix systems, this is usally the "$HOME/.vim" directory. For MS-Windows
systems, this is usually the $VIM\vimfiles or $HOME\vimfiles directory.
Depending on the type of the runtime file, you have to place it under a
specific directory under the above runtime directory. The names of the
directories are listed below:

    colors/   - color scheme files
    compiler/ - compiler files
    doc/      - documentation
    ftplugin/ - filetype plugins
    indent/   - indent scripts

You can extend an existing filetype plugin by creating a file under either
the $VIMRTUNTIME/after/ftplugin or the $VIMRTUNTIME/ftplugin directory. The
name of the file should be the same as the name of the existing filetype
plugin file. You can place your additions to the new file.

If you placed the file in the after/ftplugin runtime directory, then Vim
will first source the existing filetype plugin file and then will source
the new file.  If you placed the file in the $VIMRTUNTIME/ftplugin runtime
directory, then Vim will first source the new file and then will source the
existing filetype plugin file.

[1m26.6.[m [36mHow do I override settings made in a file type plugin in the global[m

You can use an autocommand triggered on the FileType event:

    au Filetype * set formatoptions=xyz

This should at least be after "filetype on" in your vimrc. Best is to put
it in your "myfiletypefile" file, so that it's always last.

If you want to override a setting for a particular filetype, then create a
file with the same name as the original filetype plugin in the
~/.vim/after/ftplugin directory For example, to override a setting in the
c.vim filetype plugin, create a c.vim file in the ~/.vim/after/ftplugin
directory and add your preferences in this file.

option to 'c' for all files with extension '.x', you can use the following
autocmd:

    autocmd! BufRead,BufNewFile *.x     setfiletype c

A better alternative to the above approach is to create a filetype.vim file

Subject: Re: Terminal into vim, best options???
From: Nico Raffo
To: vim_use 

There are quite a few options out there, all with their strengths and
weaknesses. Shell integration is at the top of the Vim wish list. I'm
sure Bram would be more interested in including it if someone
developed and maintained a kick-ass patch :-)

Here is a (quite biased) overview of what's currently available:

Conque Shell
URL: http://code.google.com/p/conque/
Author: Nico Raffo (me!)
Requirements: *nix, python-enabled vim
Type: Plugin

Conque is a Vim plugin, written with Vim script and python. It turns
your Vim buffer into a terminal emulator. In INSERT mode your buffer
behaves like a standard unix terminal. In NORMAL mode you can navigate/
search/page through the terminal output.

Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Near complete VT100 support (you can run emacs in a vim buffer)
 * Use of Vim features in terminal, including syntax highlighting,
copy/paste, etc
 * Active development

Cons:
 * No Windows support (coming with Vim 7.3)
 * Can be slow, especially with programs which use a lot of terminal
colors

Vimshell
URL: http://github.com/Shougo/vimshell + http://github.com/Shougo/vimproc
Author: Shougo M
Requirements: Works on both *nix and Windows. One small, independent
component may need to be compiled from C source.
Type: Plugin

Vimshell is a shell, written in the Vim scripting language, that runs
in a Vim buffer. The shell was written to take full advantage of all
of Vim's features, for example you can use Vim's omnicomplete
features, or any other normal mode Vim commands, to edit your command
line. Great potential, but missing a few features, particularly
regarding interactive programs.

Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Edit the command line with Vim, full use of Vim features in both
normal and insert mode
 * Very fast, since there is no background process required
 * Windows support
 * Active development

Cons:
 * Very limited support of interactive programs such as bash, mysql or
python.
 * Shell has incomplete functionality compared to bash, etc.
 * Documentation only available in Japanese.


screen.vim (Vim + screen/tmux)
URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2711
Author: Eric Van Dewoestine
Requirements: *nix
Type: Plugin

screen.vim is a Vim plugin which streamlines and enhances the
experience of running split screen terminal with Vim running in one of
the windows and a terminal running in the other. It uses the programs
screen or tmux to manage the split windows and to run the terminal
emulation. Both of these programs are very mature, and will give a
better terminal experience than any other option. However since the
terminal is running independently of Vim, you won't be able to use Vim
commands to interact with the terminal output.

Pros:
 * Easy to install
 * Great shell support
 * Active development

Cons:
 * No use of Vim commands to manage the shell window
 * Relatively little integration between Vim and the shell


Vim-Shell
URL: http://www.wana.at/vimshell/
Author: Thomas Wanda
Requirements: *nix, patch and recompile Vim from source
Type: Extension

Vim-Shell is a Vim extension which converts a buffer into a terminal
emulator. The shell window itself is very fast and functionality is
very strong. It is works great for running complex interactive
programs. However the Vim buffer where it runs is no longer editable
(you can't scroll up, or even move the cursor). The last official
release was for Vim 7.0, although time spent searching on Google will
turn up patches for Vim 7.1 and 7.2.

Pros:
 * Near complete VT100 support (you can run emacs in a vim buffer, and
   just about anything else)
 * Very fast. Compiled into the C source

Cons:
 * Relatively difficult to install
 * No use of Vim features to navigate terminal output
 * No Windows or Mac support.
 * No development activity since 2006


Vimsh
URL: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=165
Author: Brian Sturk
Requirements: python-enabled vim
Type: Plugin

Vimsh is a Vim plugin which allows you to run interactive programs in
a vim buffer. It provides a nice option for Windows use, but
functionality is overall less mature than the other options.

Pros:
 * Relatively easy to install
 * Use Vim commands to edit commands and navigate terminal output
 * Support in both *nix and Windows (no interactive programs in
   Windows)

Cons:
 * Limited functionality
 * Inactive development

You can use the special keyword <cword> to pass the word under the cursor
to an external command. For example:

    :!dict <cword>

[1m30.3.[m [36mHow do I get the output of a shell command into a Vim buffer?[m

You can use the "[36;1m:r[m !" command to get the output of a shell command into a
Vim buffer. For example, to insert the output of the "ls" shell command,
you can use the following command:

    [36;1m:r[m !ls

To insert the output of the shell command above the first line use the
following command:

    [36;1m:0r[m !ls

      command and replace the contents of the buffer with the output from
      the command?

You can use the :! command to pipe the contents of the current buffer to an
external command and replace the contents of the buffer with the output
from the command. For example, to sort the contents of the current buffer,
using the Unix sort command, you can use the following command:

    :%!sort

To sort only lines 10-20, you can use the following command

    [36;1m:10[m,20!sort

Also, if you want to pipe a buffer to an external command but not put the
results back in the buffer, you can use

    [36;1m:w[m !sort

The above command will pipe the entire buffer to the sort command.  Note,
that the space between the 'w' and the '!' is critical.  To pipe only a
range of lines, you can use

    [36;1m:10[m,20w !sort

The above command will pipe the lines 10-20 to the sort command.

You use the "[36;1m:sort[m" command like this:

   [36;1m:5[m,100sort

Using the "[36;1m:sort[m" command provides many options, you can sort numerical on
the first found decimal number using:
   
   :%sort n

Or you can specify to sort on the text, starting at virtual column 8:

   :%sort /.*\%8v/

Alternatively can pipe a section of the file to the Unix "sort" utility to
sort the file. For example:

    [36;1m:5[m,100!sort

You can also use a visual block, and use the "!sort" command on the
selected block.

modifying Vim. When the scrollbar is used, the cursor will be moved so that
it is always visible. Another approach to solving this problem is to use

[1m32.1.[m [36mI am running Vim in a xterm. When I press the CTRL-S key, Vim[m
      freezes. What should I do now?

Many terminal emulators and real terminal drivers use the CTRL-S key to
stop the data from arriving so that you can stop a fast scrolling display
to look at it (also allowed older terminals to slow down the computer so
that it did not get buffer overflows).  You can start the output again by
pressing the CTRL-Q key.

When you press the CTRL-S key, the terminal driver will stop sending the
output data. As a result of this, it will look like Vim is hung. If you
press the CTRL-Q key, then everything will be back to normal.

You can turn off the terminal driver flow control using the 'stty' command:

    $ stty -ixon -ixoff

or, you can change the keys used for the terminal flow control, using the
following commands:

This will prevent Vim from opening the X display. With this command-line
option, the X clipboard cannot be used and also Vim will not be able to

The easiest and simplest way to get Vim syntax highlighting is to use the
GUI version of Vim (GVIM). To get syntax highlighting to work in the
console/terminal version of Vim, you have to run a terminal emulator (like
Xfree86 xterm or rxvt or dtterm) that supports color. Note that if a
terminal emulator supports changing the background and foreground colors,
that does not mean that it also supports ANSI escape sequences for changing
the color. You can download the latest version of Xfree86 xterm from
http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html. You can download the latest version
of rxvt from http://www.rxvt.org. You have to install the terminfo/termcap
file that supports colors for the terminal emulator. Also, set the TERM
environment variable to the correct name of the term that supports colors.

You can use the colortest.vim script supplied with the Vim runtime
package to test the color setup. To use this script, follow these steps:

If you get the following warning message, everytime you save a file:

    Do you really want to write to it (y/n)?

then this problem could be related to a bug in MS-Windows on the day
daylight saving time starts.  Vim remembers the timestamp of the file after
it was written.  Just before the next write the timestamp is obtained again
to check if the file was changed outside of Vim.  This works correctly,
except on the day daylight saving time starts.

This problem will go away the next day after the day the daylight saving
time starts.

[1m35.1.[m [36mHow do I build Vim from the sources on a Unix system?[m

For a Unix system, follow these steps to build Vim from the sources:

- Download the source and run-time files archive (vim-##.tar.bz2) from the
  ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix directory.
- Extract the archive using the bzip2 and tar utilities using the command:

        $ bunzip2 -c <filename> | tar -xf -

- Alternatively, download the source from the mercurial repository:
  http://code.google.com/p/vim/source/checkout
- Run the 'make' command to configure and build Vim with the default
  configuration.
- Run 'make install' command to install Vim in the default directory.

To enable/disable various Vim features, before running the 'make' command
you can run the 'configure' command with different flags to include/exclude
the various Vim features. To list all the available options for the
'configure' command, use:

    $ configure -help

To install Vim in a directory other than the default installation
directory, you have to specify the directory using the --prefix option
while running the configure script.

    $ ./configure --prefix=/users/xyz

You can enable/disable various Vim feature by supplying different arguments
to the configure script. For more information about all these options, run

[1m35.3.[m [36mHow do I build Vim from the sources on a MS-Windows system?[m

For a MS-Windows system, Vim can be built using either the Visual C++
compiler or the Borland C++ compiler or the Ming GCC compiler or the cygwin
gcc compiler. Follow these steps to build Vim from the sources for
MS-Windows:

- Download the source (vim##src.zip), runtime (vim##rt.zip) and the extra
  (vim-##-extra.tar.gz) archives from the ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc
  directory.
- Extract the archives into a directory (for example, c:\vimsrc)
- Alternatively, download the source from the mercurial repository:
  http://code.google.com/p/vim/source/checkout
- Depending on the installed compiler, you can use the corresponding
  makefile to build the Vim sources. For Visual C++ use the Make_mvc.mak
  makefile, for borland C++ use the Make_bc5.mak makefile, for ming GCC use
  the Make_ming.mak makefile, for cygwin gcc use the Make_cyg.mak makefile.

Depending on whether you want to build the GUI version of Vim or the
console version of Vim, you have to pass different arguments to the
makefiles. After successfully building the sources, you can copy the
vim.exe or gvim.exe file to the desired directory along with the files from
the runtime archive.

Use the following shell script named gtk-config:

    #!/bin/sh
    pkg-config gtk+-2.0 $1 $2


[1m35.10.[m [36mI did successfully download the sources and compiled Vim on[m
        Unix. But feature ... still does not work. What is wrong and
        how can I fix it?

You should first check, that you are actually running your self compiled
Vim and not the system's provided version. So first check your $PATH
setting.

Depending on your compile options, some features might not be included in
your build of Vim. You can use the "[36;1m:version[m" command to determine the Vim
features that are enabled at compile time. The features that are enabled
will be prefixed with a "+". The features that are not enabled will be
prefixed with a "-".

The easiest way to include all features is to build the huge version. To do
this, you have to specify the --with-features option while running the
configure script:

    $ ./configure --with-features=huge

Nevertheless, a feature could still be disabled at compile time, if the
configure script can't find the required libraries for those features (e.g.
for clipboard integration, your Vim needs to be linked against the X11
development libraries). 

There are several ways to install the required libraries:

[1m1[m [36m On a Debian based distribution, you can use the package manager "apt" to[m
   install all required dependencies. As superuser, run the command:

   $ apt-get build-dep vim-gtk

   This makes sure all required libraries needed to compile the vim-gtk
   package will be installed. (This requires, that your sources list
   contains deb-src entries. See your distribution manual on how to enable
   this, if the above command did not work.)

[1m2[m [36m In openSUSE you can use the package manager "zypper" to install all[m
   required libraries. This requires, that there is a source version of the
   package installable from a configured repository (which by default is not
   the case). Use:

   $ zypper search -t srcpackage vim

   to find out, whether or not there exists a source version in the
   repository. If there is none, you'll need to add a source repository.
   For openSUSE 11.2 you could use, e.g.
   
   $ zypper ar
   http://download.opensuse.org/source/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/src-11.2

   (one line)

   Once you have a source version available in your repositories, use this
   command to install all needed requirements:

   $ zypper source-install --build-deps-only vim

[1m3[m [36m On a Fedora/RedHat based system, you can use[m
   
   $ yum-builddep vim-enhanced

[1m4[m [36m Run configure with your options and watch for missing libraries:[m
  
   $ ./configure --with-features=huge 2>&1 |tee logfile

   This will run configure and record the output into the file "logfile".
   You need to check the logfile for missing dependencies. Consider this
   output:

    checking --disable-gtktest argument... gtk test enabled
    checking for pkg-config... /usr/bin/pkg-config
    checking for GTK - version >= 2.2.0... no

    Here you can see, that the gtk libraries are missing and therefore no
    GTK gui version can't be build. So you need to install the GTK library
    in your system, with your package manager or by compiling it yourself.
    Then run the configure script again and check, that it finds the
    library.

In theory, those provided dependencies by your distribution might still
lack some libraries, that are needed for features, that simply are not
enabled in your distribution and therefore those commands in 1-3 won't
install it. At the very least, this provides a jumping point and you need
to track down the required missing packages using method 4 from above. But
usually, this works good enough for most people and you won't have to
bother with the fourth method.

[1m36.7.[m [36mHow do I invoke Vim from command line to run a group of commands on a[m
      group of files?

There are several ways to invoke Vim from command line to run a group of
commands on a group of files. You can use a set of  "-c" command line
options to specify a group of commands:

    $ vim -c "<ex_command_1>" -c "<ex_command_2>" *.txt

Each of the ex-command specified with the "-c" command line option is
executed one by one sequentially. You can also use a single "-c" command
line option and the "|" character to separate the ex commands:

    $ vim -c "<ex_command_1> | <ex_command_2>" *.txt

In the above command, if an ex command fails, then all the remaining ex
commands will not be executed.

For example, to replace "ABC" with "DEF" in a file from the command-line,
you can use the following command:

    $ vim -c "%s/ABC/DEF/ge | update" myfile.txt

To replace "ABC" with "DEF" in multiple files from the command-line,
you can use the following command:

    $ vim -c "argdo %s/ABC/DEF/ge | update" *.txt

You can store the group of commands into a file and use the "-s" command
line option to run the commands on a set of files. For example, if the
group of commands are stored in the file mycmds.txt, then you can use the
following command:

    $ vim -s mycmds.txt *.pl

You should first check the output of the "[36;1m:version[m" command and make
sure that +xterm-clipboard is present.

When running Vim in an xterm, you can either let Vim control the mouse
or let xterm control the mouse. This is configured by the 'mouse' option.

If the 'mouse' option is not set (or set to the default value), then Vim will
not control the mouse. You cannot move the Vim text cursor using the
mouse. When you select some text using the mouse, xterm will copy
it to the X11 cut buffer. When you press both the mouse buttons,
xterm will paste the text from the cut buffer.

If the 'mouse' option is set to 'a' or some other value, then Vim controls
the mouse. The mode (normal or insert or visual, etc) in which Vim
controls the mouse is configured by the 'mouse' option. You can move
the Vim text cursor using the mouse. When you select some text,
the 'clipboard' option setting is used to determine whether to transfer
the selected text to the clipboard or not. The default setting is to
transfer the selected text to the clipboard. If you want to use the
xterm selection mechanism in this mode, then you can press the
<Shift> key. If you press <Shift> key when selecting text using the
mouse, then Vim doesn't control the mouse and xterm controls the
mouse.

In the GUI mode, Copy and Paste should just work, depending on the 'mouse'
setting. For more information, read

Yes. It may be more or less complicated depending on the keyboard and fonts
available to you, but it is always possible to encode any possible Unicode
codepoint (and some illegal ones) into a file. To create a Unicode file
using Vim, you should have compiled Vim with the "+multi_byte" compile-time
option.  You can get more information about Unicode from the following
sites:

[1m37.3.[m [36mWhat is the 'encoding' option?[m

Basically, the 'encoding' option defines how Vim will represent your data
internally.  However, all Unicode encodings are represented internally as
utf-8 and converted (if necessary) when reading and writing.

For more information, read

    [36;1m:help[m 'encoding'


[1m37.4.[m [36mHow does Vim name the various Unicode encodings?[m

Utf-8 is called utf-8 or utf8; utf-16 is called ucs-2 or ucs2; utf-32 is
called ucs-4 or ucs4. Also, you may specify endianness (except for utf-8
which does not vary for endianness) by appending le for little-endian or be
for big-endian. If you create a file with an encoding of ucs-2 or ucs-4
without specifying endianness, Vim will use what is typical of your
machine.

[1m37.5.[m [36mHow does Vim specify the presence or absence of a byte-order mark?[m

When reading a file, if the 'fileencodings' option includes "ucs-bom", Vim
will check for a byte-order mark. When writing a file, if the 'bomb' option
is set, Vim will write a byte-order mark on files whose encoding warrants
it.

    [36;1m:help[m 'bomb'


[1m37.6.[m [36mWhat is the 'fileencoding' option?[m

The 'fileencoding' option defines the particular encoding which Vim will
use to write a file. If empty, then the value of the 'encoding' option is
the default.

For more information, read

    [36;1m:help[m 'fileencoding'


[1m37.7.[m [36mWhat is the 'fileencodings' option?[m

The 'fileencodings' option defines the heuristics used by Vim when opening
an existing file. It is a comma separated list of encodings. A special
name, "ucs-bom" is used to indicate that Vim should check for the presence
of a byte-order mark; however, it will not be recognised if it comes after
"utf-8".  Normally, "ucs-bom" (if present) should be first in the list.

When Vim opens a file, it checks it against the encodings listed in
'fileencodings'. The first one that matches is used. If there is no match,
then Vim sets 'fileencoding' to the null string, i.e., the value of
'encoding' will be used.

[1m37.8.[m [36mWhat is the 'termencoding' option?[m

The 'termencoding' option defines how your keyboard encodes the data you
type.  If empty, Vim assumes that it has the same value as 'encoding'.
Usually it should be set to something that matches your locale.

[1m37.9.[m [36mWhat is the 'bomb' option?[m

When reading a file with "ucs-bom" present in the 'fileencodings' option,
Vim will set the 'bomb' option on or off depending on the presence or
absence of a byte-order mark at the start of the file. When writing, Vim
will write a byte-order mark if the 'bomb' option is set. You may set or
unset it manually do make Vim write, or not write, the b.o.m.

[1m37.11.[m [36mHow can I insert Unicode characters into a file using Vim?[m

Several methods are available:

- Characters present on your keyboard can be typed in the usual way, even
  those which require a "dead-key" prefix, like (for instance) the
  circumflex on French keyboards.
- Characters for which a digraph is defined can be typed as two characters
  prefixed by <Ctrl-K>.
- If you have set the 'digraph' option, you can enter the characters for
  which a digrph is defined as <char1><BS><char2>.
- Any character can be entered by using a <Ctrl-V> prefix (or <Ctrl-Q> if
  <Ctrl-V> is remapped to paste from the clipboard).

[1m37.12.[m [36mHow can I know which digraphs are defined and for which characters?[m

First set the 'encoding' option properly (for instance, to utf-8), then use
the [36;1m:digraphs[m command to list the currently defined digraphs.
